# SQLitePrePop

This project demonstrates the results of a task assigned to me during a mobile development course at Karelia University of Applied Sciences.

The application's main function is to read a prepopulated SQLite database. It displays the content in a List View, and further details in a separate Content Page when a row is selected.

Permissions given to platforms:

Android - Internet

iOS - YouTube and its Subdomains added to exception domains
